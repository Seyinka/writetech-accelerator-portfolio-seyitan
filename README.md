# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains ‚Äî including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 ‚Äî using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

_A short 2‚Äì3 sentence professional summary. Include your background, writing interests, and what you‚Äôre hoping to achieve with technical writing._

Example:  
I'm a technical writer with a background in software development and a passion for clear, user-focused documentation. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I‚Äôve built during the WriteTech Accelerator.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
