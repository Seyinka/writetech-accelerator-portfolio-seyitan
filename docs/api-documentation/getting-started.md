## What I Improved
- Added prerequisites (Python 3.7+, pip).
- Step-by-step installation using `pip install fastapi uvicorn`.
- Clear instructions to run the app and access auto-generated Swagger UI.

## Challenges
- Balancing between simplicity for beginners and detail for advanced users.
- Making sure setup instructions worked consistently across environments.

## What I Learnt
- Installation docs should always include prerequisites and verification steps.
- FastAPIâ€™s interactive docs make it easy to validate the setup.
